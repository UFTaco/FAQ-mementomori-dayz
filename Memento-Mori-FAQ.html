      <h2 id="whitelisting--validation">WHITELISTING / VALIDATION</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I not whitelisted? / How do I whitelist?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> You will have to whitelist yourself by using the command <code>"/validatesteamid"</code>
        followed by your <strong>Steam64ID</strong> in the <a
          href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/959546632863617024">#validate-steam-id</a> chat, which
        has more info and a step-by-step process.
      </p>


      <h2 id="joining-the-server">JOINING THE SERVER</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I join the server?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> Make sure you have completed the whitelist process mentioned above via <a
          href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/959546632863617024">#validate-steam-id</a>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set/change your launcher profile name (<code>Parameters &gt; All Parameters &gt; Profile Name</code> check
          the box, set name) to something other than “Survivor”. If you don’t the server will tell you are “banned” if
          you try to join.</li>
        <li>Enter the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/957142319876935741">🔊Join to Play
            Server</a> voice channel. You will be temporarily “banned” and/or disconnected from the server if you are
          not in this voice channel while playing.</li>
        <li>Search for “<strong>Memento Mori</strong>” in the default or third-party launchers. Click
          “<strong>JOIN</strong>”. Click "<strong>SETUP DLCS AND MODS AND JOIN"</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>NOTICE</strong>: If you care about how your character looks, you will have to set it up before joining.
        You will not get to customize it later, since that requires dying. See the <strong>CUSTOM CHARACTER</strong>
        section below.<br>
        Direct connect if searching doesn’t work (you will have to set up mods manually before joining. See the
        following <strong>MODS</strong> section for more info).</p>
      <p><strong>-</strong> <em>Server IP:</em> <code>144.217.252.233</code><br>
        <strong>-</strong> <em>Port:</em> <code>2302</code>
      </p>
      <p>Don’t forget to favorite the server to find it quickly later!</p>

      <h2 id="mods">MODS</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What mods do I need?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> If you need to manually add mods or to reference their additions or changes, they all are
        listed in this collection:<br>
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835331576"

      </p>
      <h2 id="bans">BANS</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I <em>banned</em>?!<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> There are three reasons why you could be “banned” from the server.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>You are not occupying the <a
            href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/957142319876935741">🔊Join to Play Server</a> voice
          channel.</li>
        <li>You may need to set/change your launchers profile name. It can’t be “Survivor”. (See <strong>JOINING THE
            SERVER</strong> section above)</li>
        <li>Your character has died in game. See you next season!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If these don’t seem to cover your situation, please submit a ticket via <a
          href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/970008942098919465">#help-center</a> describing the
        situation and include your SteamID</p>
      <h2 id="high-ping--ping-whitelisting">HIGH PING / PING WHITELISTING</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> My ping is too high to reliably play. What can I do?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> Submit a ticket via <a
          href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/970008942098919465">#help-center</a> describing the
        situation and include your SteamID to request ping whitelisting.<br>
        Include your <strong>Steam64ID</strong>, same as you used to validate.<br>
        Doing this, you understand you are at greater risk of death by lag and will accept the consequences.
      </p>


      <h2 id="new-life--respawns">NEW LIFE / RESPAWNS</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I come back after I die?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> After a two-week period from death, a player can use our donation link to purchase a new
        life: <a href="https://donatebot.io/checkout/749808733780967496"
          title="https://donatebot.io/checkout/749808733780967496">donatebot.io/checkout/</a> Or you can wait till the
        next season starts (every 3 months).
      </p>


      <h2 id="wipes-and-seasons">WIPES AND SEASONS</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there wipes/seasons?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, there are wipes about every 90 days from the beginning of each new season, roughly
        aligned with real world seasons.<br>
        With every wipe characters will be reset, bases and items will we wiped, and all the dead will come back to life
        to try again.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> When is the next season starting?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> The last season started <strong>June 15th</strong>.<br>
        Currently, the next season will begin sometime <strong>mid-October</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="died-but-not-banned">DIED BUT NOT BANNED</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I <strong>died</strong> but did <em>not</em> get banned. What should I do?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> Submit a ticket via <a
          href="https://discord.com/channels/749808733780967496/970008942098919465">#help-center</a> with your in-game
        alias/name, when it happened (include your time-zone), and what took place. This will help us track down issues
        that caused you to be missed by the death watch script and fix them.<br>
        This often occurs when you log out while unconscious, which kills your character. So if you want to try to keep
        surviving, don’t log while unconscious.<br>
        If we find that someone has died and <em>not</em> reported it and kept playing, they will be banned effective
        immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 id="custom-character">CUSTOM CHARACTER</h2>
      <p><strong>Notice:</strong> If you have already joined the server once you cannot change your character anymore as
        that requires dying, which will ban you. Sorry.</p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I get a custom character?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> <strong>Notice:</strong> This process is a bit inconsistent and may not work. The in-game
        server browser might not find the server or the character customization won’t apply after joining. We are unsure
        why.<br>
        To (try) get a custom character, you will need to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manually select all the server’s mods via the mods section. List can be found here: <a
            href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835331576"
            title="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835331576">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835331576</a>
        </li>
        <li>Click the launchers “<strong>PLAY</strong>” button to launch to the game’s main menu, not into the server.
        </li>
        <li>Find the character which has the “<strong>Customize Character</strong>” option. Customize and save your
          character.</li>
        <li>Click “<strong>PLAY</strong>” or "<strong>Change Server"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Go to “<strong>COMMUNITY</strong>” tab.</li>
        <li>Enter “<strong>Memento</strong>” in the “<strong>SEARCH BY NAME</strong>” field filter and click
          <strong>APPLY FILTER</strong> below. You may need to wait awhile for the server to appear.</li>
        <li>Once it does, click on it to highlight, then click the “<strong>PLAY</strong>” button to join.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="backpack">BACKPACK</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why can’t I see my backpacks inventory?!<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> It’s a mod. You must have the backpack in your hand or on the ground near you to access it’s
        inventory.
      </p>
      <h2 id="combat-logging">COMBAT LOGGING</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I can’t log out quickly? / I was sent to prison?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> We have implemented a combat log protection that increase the time to log out when you fire
        a weapon or someone within 150m of you does.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you log out during this time without waiting for it to deactivate or wait the timer to decrease naturally
          before clicking “<strong>EXIT NOW</strong>” you will be teleported to the jail which has all doors locked, so
          you can’t escape.</li>
        <li>There are some known issues with some players getting the combat log status without having fired a weapon.
          You still need to wait till the timer ends, or you will be jailed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="hand-bugs">HAND BUGS</h2>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I can’t put/switch items in my hands or interact with the world?<br>
        <strong>A:</strong> This is a known DayZ bug, usually due to high player latency (if even for only a moment)
        while switching hand items too quickly and often. It does seem to happen with greater occurrence on our server,
        possibly due to some mod interactions, but we’ve yet to narrow it down.<br>
        The easiest fix it to log out and back in.
